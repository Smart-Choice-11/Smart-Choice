  "description": "Meet Google Pixel 7. Powered by Google Tensor G2, it’s fast and secure, with amazing battery life and the advanced Pixel Camera for beautifully authentic, accurate photos with Real Tone and stunning video with Cinematic Blur. Plus, it’s Pixel’s most refined design, made with recycled materials.[11] LEGAL [1]Compared to Pixel 6. Speed and power efficiency claims based on internal testing on pre-production devices. [2]Works with all major carriers. 5G service is carrier dependent. Requires a 5G data plan (sold separately). 5G service not available on all carrier networks or in all areas. Contact carrier for details. 5G service, speed, and performance depend on many factors, including carrier network capabilities and signal strength. Actual results may vary. Some features not available in all areas. Data rates may apply. See g.co/pixel/networkinfo for info. [3]For “over 24 hours”: Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of other features. Average battery life during testing was approximately 31 hours. Battery testing conducted on a major carrier network. For “Up to 72 hours”: Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of limited other features that are default in Extreme Battery Saver mode (which disables various features including 5G connectivity). Battery testing conducted on a major carrier network. For both claims: Battery testing conducted in California in mid 2022 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings, except that, for the “up to 72 hours” claim only, Extreme Battery Saver mode was enabled. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Actual battery life may be lower. [4]Measured diagonally; dimension may vary by configuration and manufacturing process. Smooth Display is not available for all apps or content. [5]Not available for all camera apps or modes. [6]Coming soon. Restrictions apply. Some data is not transmitted through VPN. Not available in all countries. All other Google One membership benefits sold separately. Use of VPN may increase data costs depending on your plan. See g.co/pixel/vpn for details. [7]Earbuds and watch sold separately. Requires Pixel Buds Pro connected with Fast Pair to a device with location history enabled. Requires Google Pixel Watch to be connected to a compatible device. [8]Designed to comply with dust and water protection rating IP68 (for Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) and IP67 (for Pixel 6a) under IEC standard 60529 when each device leaves the factory but the device is not water or dust proof. The accessories are not water or dust resistant. Water resistance and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and will diminish or be lost over time due to normal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage. Dropping your device may result in loss of water/dust resistance. Liquid damage voids the warranty. See g.co/pixel/water for details. [9]Requires Google Photos app. Magic Eraser may not work on all image elements. [10]Some third party apps and data may not be transferred automatically. Visit g.co/pixel/copydatahelp for information. [11]Recycled materials are approximately 19% of phone based on weight. [12]Not available in all languages or countries. Not available on all media or apps. See g.co/pixel/livetranslate for more information. Translation may not be instantaneous. [13]Maximum resolution and field of view with RAW image files setting turned on. Setting is turned off by default. See g.co/pixel/photoediting for more information. [14]Storage specifications refer to capacity before formatting. Actual formatted capacity will be less. [15]Unblurring may not work on all photos or videos with faces. [16]Requires compatible smart device. [17]The Google One and YouTube Premium 3-month trial offers are available to eligible users with the purchase of Pixel 7 Pro. Offer expires December 15, 2023 at 11:59 pm PT. Valid form of payment required at sign-up, but you will not be charged until the trial period expires. Cancel anytime. See youtube.com/premium/restrictions and one.google.com/offer/terms-and-conditions/pixel7and7pro for full terms. [18]See g.co/pixel/astrophotography for details. [19]Watch and earbuds sold separately. [20]Pixel Stand sold separately. Wireless charging rates up to 20W (Pixel 7) and up to 23W (Pixel 7 Pro) charging with Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen) (sold separately). Up to 12W with Qi-certified EPP chargers (sold separately). Actual results may be slower. [21]Measured diagonally; dimension may vary by configuration and manufacturing process. [22]Wireless charging rates up to 20W (Pixel 7) and up to 23W (Pixel 7 Pro) charging with Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen) (sold separately). Up to 12W with Qi-certified EPP chargers (sold separately). Actual results may be slower. Fast wired charging rates (up to 18W on Pixel 6a, up to 20W on Pixel 7 and up to 23W on Pixel 7 Pro) are based upon use of the Google 30W USB-C® Charger or Google 18W USB-C® (Pixel 6a only) plugged into a wall outlet. Actual results may be slower. Chargers and Pixel Stand sold separately. [23]Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of other features. Average battery life during testing was approximately 29 hours. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Battery testing conducted in California in early 2022 on pre-production hardware and software, using default settings. Battery testing conducted using Sub-6 GHz non-standalone 5G (ENDC) connectivity. Actual battery life may be lower.",

  "description": "Meet Pixel 7 Pro, Google’s best-of-everything phone. Powered by Google Tensor G2, it’s fast and secure, with an immersive display and amazing battery life. It features the best Pixel camera yet, with a telephoto lens and pro-level features like Macro Focus, Cinematic Blur, and more. Plus, it’s Pixel’s most refined design, made with recycled materials.[20] LEGAL [1]Compared to Pixel 6. Speed and power efficiency claims based on internal testing on pre-production devices. [2]Works with all major carriers. 5G service is carrier dependent. Requires a 5G data plan (sold separately). 5G service not available on all carrier networks or in all areas. Contact carrier for details. 5G service, speed, and performance depend on many factors, including carrier network capabilities and signal strength. Actual results may vary. Some features not available in all areas. Data rates may apply. See g.co/pixel/networkinfo for info. [3]For “over 24 hours”: Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of other features. Average battery life during testing was approximately 31 hours. Battery testing conducted on a major carrier network. For “Up to 72 hours”: Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of limited other features that are default in Extreme Battery Saver mode (which disables various features including 5G connectivity). Battery testing conducted on a major carrier network. For both claims: Battery testing conducted in California in mid 2022 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings, except that, for the “up to 72 hours” claim only, Extreme Battery Saver mode was enabled. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Actual battery life may be lower. [4]Measured diagonally; dimension may vary by configuration and manufacturing process. Not available for all apps or content. [5]Not available for all camera apps or modes. [6]Coming soon. Restrictions apply. Some data is not transmitted through VPN. Not available in all countries. All other Google One membership benefits sold separately. Use of VPN may increase data costs depending on your plan. See g.co/pixel/vpn for details. [7]Earbuds and watch sold separately. Requires Pixel Buds Pro connected with Fast Pair to a device with location history enabled. Requires Google Pixel Watch to be connected to a compatible device. [8]Designed to comply with dust and water protection rating IP68 under IEC standard 60529 when each device leaves the factory but the device is not water or dust proof. The accessories are not water or dust resistant. Water resistance and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and will diminish or be lost over time due to normal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage. Dropping your device may result in loss of water/dust resistance. Liquid damage voids the warranty. See g.co/pixel/water for details. [9]Maximum resolution and field of view with RAW image files setting turned on. Setting is turned off by default. See g.co/pixel/photoediting for more information. [10]Some third party apps and data may not be transferred automatically. Visit g.co/pixel/copydatahelp for information. [11]Not available in all languages or countries. Not available on all media or apps. See g.co/pixel/livetranslate for more information. Translation may not be instantaneous. [12]Storage specifications refer to capacity before formatting. Actual formatted capacity will be less. [13]Magic Eraser requires Google Photos app and may not work on all image elements. [14]Unblurring may not work on all photos or videos with faces. [15]Requires compatible smart device. [16]The Google One and YouTube Premium 3-month trial offers are available to eligible users with the purchase of Pixel 7 Pro. Offer expires December 15, 2023 at 11:59 pm PT. Valid form of payment required at sign-up, but you will not be charged until the trial period expires. Cancel anytime. See youtube.com/premium/restrictions and one.google.com/offer/terms-and-conditions/pixel7and7pro for full terms. [17]Based on use of Smooth Display (not available for all apps or content). [18]See g.co/pixel/astrophotography for details. [19]Watch and earbuds sold separately. [20]Recycled materials are approximately 19% of phone based on weight. [21]Wireless charging rates up to 20W (Pixel 7) and up to 23W (Pixel 7 Pro) charging with Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen). Up to 12W with Qi-certified EPP chargers. Actual results may be slower. Fast wired charging rates (up to 18W on Pixel 6a, up to 20W on Pixel 7 and up to 23W on Pixel 7 Pro) are based upon use of the Google 30W USB-C® Charger or Google 18W USB-C® (Pixel 6a only) plugged into a wall outlet. Actual results may be slower. Chargers and Pixel Stand sold separately. [22]Measured diagonally; dimension may vary by configuration and manufacturing process [23]Requires compatible USB-C® device (sold separately). Charging speed varies and depends on device capabilities, battery age, usage during charging, and many other factors. [24]Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of other features. Average battery life during testing was approximately 29 hours. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Battery testing conducted in California in early 2022 on pre-production hardware and software, using default settings. Battery testing conducted using Sub-6 GHz non-standalone 5G (ENDC) connectivity. Actual battery life may be lower.",

  "description": "The NexYZ DX Kit is a great way to step into the world of astroimaging and digiscoping. This universal adapter kit provides you everything you need to capture sharp, detailed images and video. NexYZ’s patented design fits any eyepiece from 35mm to 60mm in diameter, including telescopes with 1.25-inch and 2-inch eyepieces, spotting scopes, monoculars, and binoculars. NexYZ will also attach to microscopes with the addition of the included adapter ring, which takes the usable diameter down to 25mm, the size of a standard microscope eyepiece. A strong spring and a threaded twist lock provide a secure grip on the optical instrument’s eyepiece so you can image with confidence. The universal smartphone adapter is fully adjustable to fit any device—usually with the case still on. Even larger “Pro” devices work perfectly. The secure platform stands up to the weight of these heavier devices with ease. If multiple people want to capture a shot through your optic, NexYZ’s simple spring-loaded clamps make it easy to remove one device and replace it with another in seconds. The NexYZ DX Kit is the ideal solution for star parties and group bird walks where everyone wants their own shot of the action. What makes NexYZ different from other smartphone adapters? The three-axis adjustment. Most adapters rely on you placing your phone perfectly on the platform and only offer limited adjustment in two axes. But NexYZ gives you the power to place your phone on the platform, center it over the eyepiece with the X and Y knobs, and then move up or down over the eyepiece until you have the entire field of view in your shot. And even though this adjustment is ultra-precise, it’s still quicker and easier than with other adapters. From start to finish, the process only takes about 30 seconds. If you switch phones, eyepieces, or optical instruments, you will need only slight adjustments to re-center the camera over the new eyepiece. You can also switch your image from portrait to landscape simply by turning the padded eyepiece clamp and readjusting the knobs to realign your phone with the eyepiece. The NexYZ DX Kit comes with a Bluetooth shutter release remote to capture shake-free images without disturbing the placement of your phone and telescope by pressing the on-screen button. The remote works with any Android or iOS smartphone.",
  "features": [
    "Bluetooth Shutter Release Remote: To capture the best image, this kit also comes complete with a Bluetooth shutter release remote, which allows you to trigger the camera’s shutter on any Android or iOS smartphone without touching the device’s screen or buttons; This eliminates blurriness in your images caused by the phone or telescope shaking due to pressure from pressing the button manually; Pairing your Bluetooth remote to your smartphone for the first time takes only seconds",
    "A complete digiscoping solution: NexYZ connects your smartphone to an eyepiece while the Bluetooth shutter release button helps you get a steady shot every time",
    "Connect the remote shutter release to your phone via Bluetooth to take photos or start/stop video recording without unwanted vibration",
    "Both devices work with virtually all smartphone models, including the latest devices from Apple, Samsung, and Google"
